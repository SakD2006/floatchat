# FloatChat ðŸŒŠðŸ’¬  - Smart India Hackathon
**AI-Powered Conversational Interface for ARGO Ocean Data Discovery and Visualization**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
FloatChat is an AI-driven platform designed to simplify access to the vast and complex datasets generated by the ARGO program. By combining conversational AI with interactive visualization, the solution enables researchers, students, and policymakers to explore oceanographic data seamlessly. Users can ask natural language questions and instantly receive answers backed with dynamic visualizations, maps, and charts.  

The project aims to make ocean data more accessible, intuitive, and impactful â€” helping in climate research, marine ecosystem monitoring, and sustainable development efforts.
